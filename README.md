Jump-n-Run:  It's like Minecraft but someone sat on it and squished it flat. 
No creepers! (you're welcome)

## 🎮 How to Play 
1. WASD/Arrow Keys to move left/right (shocking, I know)
2. You jump automatically because we respect your spacebar's lifespan
3. Don't fall = win
4. Fall = skill issue
5. That's it. That's literally it.

## 🛠️ Built With
- LÖVE (because who doesn't love Love2D?)
- Lua (the language that sounds like a Hawaiian greeting)

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Game
```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jump-n-run.git

# Enter the realm
cd jump-n-run

# Unleash the beast
love src
```

## 🎨 Art Style
We've carefully crafted our visual aesthetic to answer the question: "What if Minecraft had a budget of exactly $0?"

## 🤔 FAQ
Q: Is this Minecraft?  
A: No, this is Patrick.

Q: Can I dig blocks?  
A: This isn't that kind of relationship.

Q: Why 2D?  
A: Because 3D was too mainstream.

Q: Is there multiplayer?  
A: In your heart, we're all playing together.

## 🎮 Controls
- Left Arrow/A: Move left (or right, depending on your perspective on life)
- Right Arrow/D: Move right (or left, if you're in Australia)
- That's it. We believe in minimalism.
